# Railways-Registration-System
During my second semester, I completed this assignment. This is an HTML-CSS project that I created using some of the fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS. If we talk about this project, it is a railway registration system through which we collect passenger data such as date of travel, class, quota, and offer them with information on available trains at their respective stations. This modest idea has the potential to assist millions of travellers on their journey. We've also introduced a meal option, which provides suggestions for nearby restaurants and eateries, making it easier for passengers to get it. Through this project, I've learned a lot of new things. So that's all there is to it when it comes to railway registration. I learned numerous new HTML tags as a result of this assignment, which also helped me improve my web development skills. Gratitude
